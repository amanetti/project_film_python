This paper analyses a dataset1 listing the films produced by The Walt Disney Studios. From the debut film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937 to 2016, the studios have produced more than 500 films. Many of the films were major successes, but some were not. Particular attention is paid to the analysis of gross sales in order to show whether there is a connection with the other parameters.
